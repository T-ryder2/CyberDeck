# CyberDeck
A CyberDeck I created inspired by Cyberpunk 2077.

The purpose of this project was to create a platform that is smaller than a laptop while still offering the same if not better capabilities.

- The CyberDeck features a 7-inch touchscreen platform as well as a bluetooth QWERTY board when the user wishes to not hold the device.
- The CyberDeck has a battery life of approximately 36 - 48 hours which leaves plenty of life for connecting peripheral devices.
- 8gb RAM accompanied by Overclocked performance for increased speed and responsiveness.
